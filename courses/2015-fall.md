### Azure and Github account instructions ### 
As was told in the lecture we are going to work with Azure and Github this
semester. As a result gets every GiPHouse team a private Github repository and
an Azure pass with $100/month credit.

We've mailed you account details and an Azure access code, which you need to share
within your team.

You can activate your Azure account on:
[http://www.microsoftazurepass.com](http://www.microsoftazurepass.com)

After activation, you can login to:
[https://manage.windowsazure.com](https://manage.windowsazure.com), and play
around! Try to create a simple application, and host it on the cloud environment
as a first step. 

### First week tasks ###
Welcome new entrepeneurs and developers! For the first week, you need to come up
with an idea for your bicycle project.

Please make a Github account, if you don''t have one. Also, please fill in the
[Google form](http://goo.gl/forms/ZcXhM78w9i) as soon as possible, 
so that we can create an account for you on Azure and add you to the Github 
organization.
