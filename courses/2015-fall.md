deployment and testing and how you have used the Azure services for
this. No slides are allowed for this part.

successful startup: Show your business plan and how you have worked
out your idea. Also explain how you are going to make money with your
idea. Show your planning as well: What are you going to achieve this
semester after this week? You can use slides for this part if you
like.

Part 3: This part is reserved for questions and switching between
project groups.

Note that the presentation session is mandatory for all students, and

We will make the presentation schedule 'on the fly' at 11 November.

### Azure and Github account instructions ### 
As was told in the lecture we are going to work with Azure and Github this
semester. As a result gets every GiPHouse team a private Github repository and
an Azure pass with $100/month credit.

We've mailed you account details and an Azure access code, which you need to share
within your team.

You can activate your Azure account on:
[http://www.microsoftazurepass.com](http://www.microsoftazurepass.com)

After activation, you can login to:
[https://manage.windowsazure.com](https://manage.windowsazure.com), and play
around! Try to create a simple application, and host it on the cloud environment
as a first step. 

### First week tasks ###
Welcome new entrepeneurs and developers! For the first week, you need to come up
with an idea for your bicycle project.

Please make a Github account, if you don''t have one. Also, please fill in the
[Google form](http://goo.gl/forms/ZcXhM78w9i) as soon as possible, 
so that we can create an account for you on Azure and add you to the Github 
organization.
