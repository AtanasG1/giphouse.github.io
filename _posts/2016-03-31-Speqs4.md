#### About SpeqS-4

Many misunderstandings in communication can be traced back to the communicating parties not having a common view on the subject at hand.
These parties have their own idea of the concepts involved and how they relate to each other, and these viewpoints do not necessarily agree. 
The SpeqS-Language tries to solve this issue by providing a framework to organise this information using statements and their relations.

The main way to work with the SpeqS-Language is the SpeqS-Tool. The SpeqS-Tool is a highly flexible web application that provides ways to view and edit 
these ontologies of statements and their relations. These views come in many shapes: lists, 3D-graphs, tree-based structures and other options and can be
combined in almost endless ways.

The SpeqS-4 project, which will be a part of this general SpeqS framework, is to provide a variety of ways
for the users of the SpeqS-Tool to communicate with each other, including instant messaging, voice conversation, screen sharing and other options. 
Users have to be able to interact and exchange opinions, questions and answers concerning the different functions of the SpeqS-Tool. 
This communication should be done and stored with respect to the views and statements of the tool.
