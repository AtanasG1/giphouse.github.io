#### About Alewijnse

Alewijnse designs, delivers and integrates electrical engineering systems and deliver total automation. 
All over the world, for the maritime sector and industry, retail and other sectors in which technical management are important.
A substantial amount of bridges is built every year by Alewijnse not only in the Netherlands but also in the UK. 
The company is always looking for more way's to expand its business, to both bridges, but other market segments as well.

The purpose of this project is to improve the overall engineering process, and also incorporate more disciplines.
We develop a web application that will serve the needs of Alewijnse company in combining information to create a blueprint for a bridge.
When this project is done, the software should allow the user to enter specific variables, preferences, constraints and get detailed
planning of the object that is to be built. The end product will be called “The Dutch Bridge”.
